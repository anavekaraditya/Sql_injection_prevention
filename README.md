# SQLIA Prevention System in a website

<h4><p>SQL Injection is very serious problem in the website.</br>
To overcome this problem we use javascript php and md5 encryption.</br>
Every language works as a security layer in this project.</br>
Javascript prevent the use of special characters in input fields.</br>
Also php code also detect the manipulated query and prevent the system.</br>
We also use the md5 encryption for the database security.</br>
